<p>
  <b style="font-size: 35px";>The major causes of trafficking in women are as follows:</b>
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Poverty: </mark> </u> </b> Especially in poor countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka,
  poverty is the root cause of trafficking of women. The
  financially weak parents themselves sale their sons and
  daughters to the dalals for money.

  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Unemployment: </mark> </u> </b> When the male members of the family are
  not working then the females have to take the entire burden of
  running the household. The women undergo immense
  pressure to satisfy the family needs. This is taken as an
  advantage by the traffickers who lure women into the flesh
  trade.

  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Child Marriage: </mark> </u> </b> In India child marriages still exist and even
  the dowry system. The girls are trafficked in the name of
  marriage to Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Mumbai, Bihar and other
  states.

  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Social Stigma: </mark> </u> </b> In our society especially in the rural areas, the
  single, divorced, unwed, widowed and sexually abused
  women and young girls are looked down upon. The
  unwillingness of the society to accept them may lead to
  frustration on the part of these women and they become easy
  prey of the traffickers.

  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Religious Practices: </mark> </u> </b> The decades system wherein the girl is
  wedded to God and later on exploited by the temple priests,
  helps to the growth of women trafficking. Still this practice is
  continued in India. The Scheduled Caste women are made to
  work as decades. Later on they become prostitutes in the red
  light areas of the city.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Female Infanticide and Foeticide: </mark> </u> </b> The states like Punjab
  and Haryana have a very high rate of female infanticide and
  foeticide. Hence the sex ratio is not balanced in such states.
  The men in these states depends heavily on the human
  traffickers for the satisfaction of their physical needs.

  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> False Promises:</mark> </u> </b> The women who are involved in a love affair
  with a man without knowing his background are ultimately
  cheated and lured into prostitution racket. The promises of
  marriage becomes false when the man makes a DVD or MMS
  of hers which shows her in a negative way. Ultimately the
  women is blackmailed and trapped by the traffickers.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Domestic Violence: </mark> </u> </b> Due to the dowry system, the women are
  victims of the domestic violence. Wife battering is glorified in
  India. A man is considered as masculine if he ill treats his wife
  and beats her black and blue. Many women who are lucky
  enough to escape such torture are not accepted by their
  parents also. This is because even the parents feel that the
  girl after marriage is someone else’s property. Such women
  ultimately fall prey to the traffickers.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Migration: </mark> </u> </b> The men who migrate to the cities live behind their
  families. Hence to satisfy their physical needs, the market of
  human trafficking flourishes a lot in the cities.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Lack of Birth Registry: </mark> </u> </b> People who do not have proper
  registration of birth falls easily in the net of the traffickers
  because their age and nationality cannot be documented.
  Children’s who are trafficked are called as adults by the
  traffickers and they are easily passed on from one state to
  another.

  <br>
  <br>
  <b> <u> <mark> Corruption: </mark> </u> </b> The traffickers often bribe the corrupt police and
  immigration officials to overlook criminal activities. The Civil
  Servants are also bribed to falsify information on ID cards,
  birth certificates and passports making human trafficking
  easier.
