	Women trafficking and its consequences are not only far away and other people’s
problem. It is a problem of our daily life and happens right here in Winnipeg as well as in
almost every other “civilized” city all over the world. Poverty and illiteracy are the main
elements constituting the substratum for trafficking. The number of non-governmental
organisations working in the field has increased enormously during the last few years.
However, the vast majority of them are located in urban centres and very few have
grassroots connections. Women trafficking touch every country and countless industries
worldwide, and while there are many individuals and organisations working globally to
combat this problem, it may take time before it is fully realised just how huge this issue is.
The situation in the country presents a picture of lack of cohesion and coordination.
Whether it is intra-state trafficking, inter-state trafficking or trans-border trafficking, the
agencies involved in rescue do not seem to have any coordination with the agencies
concerned with rehabilitation. The issue of missing women and children has been seen in
isolation and was never seen in correlation with trafficking. There is no common platform
linking up prevention strategies between source and destination areas. The absence of a
national coordinating/monitoring agency has been a serious impediment in justice delivery
and protection of human rights. Therefore, in order to ensure the best interests of the
victims, to bring about effective coordination at the national level and to coordinate
preventive strategies, programmes and policies, there is also a need for a national nodal
agency to combat trafficking.
