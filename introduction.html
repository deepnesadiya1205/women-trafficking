	Trafficking is the organized crime which violates the basic human rights for the purpose of slavery, commercial sexual exploitation, organ transplant, begging, circus and forced marriage.The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, popularly known as the Trafficking Protocol was adopted by the United Nations in Palermo, Italy in 2000. It is an international legal agreement attached to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.This protocol tries to facilitate co-operation of the member nations to solve the issue of trafficking.The United Nations has listed India in its Tier II List as a country who has failed to combat the problem of human trafficking especially of women. In India women are treated as commodities
  and are sold in the open market. The women are trafficked from neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal to India and in many cases are trafficked to gulf countries, Middle East and Europe.Women trafficking are mostly found in states like Goa, Assam, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal.
