	<b style="font-size: 35px;">The effects of trafficking may have severe impact on the survivors.</b>

	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Rejection: </mark> </u> </b> Those who survive and come back to the normal
	community are not accepted again. The community rejects
	them and boycotts their family. The survivor has to return back
	to the brothel or commit suicide.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Helplessness: </mark> </u> </b> The victims feel helpless because they are not
	able to change the circumstances in which they are locked.
	They cannot face the situation and in the end they give up.
	They withdraw and isolate themselves and remain
	disconnected from the society. Even if they are rescued and
	rehabilitated, the feeling of helplessness continues.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Distraction: </mark> </u> </b> The victims try to engage themselves in various
	activities and try to forget their situation. They watch movies,
	fight with others and also gossip about others. They may also
	become addict to drugs, tobacco and alcohol. They also seek
	short term relationships with strangers.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Post Traumatic Stress Disaster: </mark> </u> </b> The trafficking survivors
	may experience the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is a
	general anxiety that is triggered by any cue that reminds the
	survivor of the traumatic abuse that he or she may have
	undergone. This leads to numbness of sensations.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Depressive Disorder: </mark> </u> </b> The feeling of sadness, inability to
	enjoy oneself, lack of interest in day to day activities and
	negativity about the future leads to depressive disorder in the
	victim.

	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Dissociative Disorder: </mark> </u> </b> In this, the victim becomes
	unconscious. The victim suffers from amnesia and has
	multiple personality disorder.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Psychotic Disorder: </mark> </u> </b> The victim may develop slow and steady
	degradation of his entire personality. In this disorder the victim
	has several delusions and starts hallucinating as well as faces
	various behavioural difficulties. Many rape victims suffer from
	this disorder. They loose control on their senses and hence
	they may roam without wearing clothes and they may pelt
	stones on others.

	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Eating Disorder: </mark> </u> </b> The victim may experience eating disorders.
	Due to frustration and depression, they may eat more than
	required or they may take to eating binges or they may not eat
	at all.

	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Addiction: </mark> </u> </b> The victim even after being rescued my not stop
	his addiction. They may die due to severe drug addiction and
	alcoholism.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> <u> <mark> Legal Effects: </mark> </u> </b> Due to illiteracy and ignorance the victims do
	not understand that they are exploited. They do not even know
	about the various laws of the country. They are intellectually,
	physically, emotionally weak. Their utter helplessness and
	stigma do not allow them to take help from the legal
	authorities.
